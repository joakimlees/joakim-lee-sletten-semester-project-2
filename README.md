# Semester project | Auction House | School Project at Noroff

This is my semester project for my second year studying frontend development at Noroff.

The goal here was to make a auction house website, where the following user stories should be fulfilled:

- A user with a stud.noroff.no email may register
- A registered user may login
- A registered user may logout
- A registered user may update their avatar
- A registered user may view their total credit
- A registered user may create a Listing with a title, deadline date, media gallery and description
- A registered user may add a Bid to another user’s Listing
- A registered user may view Bids made on a Listing
- A registered user may use credit to make a Bid on another user’s Listing
- An unregistered user may search through Listings

## tools and techniques

- Boostrap 5
- SCSS
- Vanilla Javascript with emphasizes on: Array methods, synchronous/asynchronous code, network requests, ES6 modules, Destructuring objects and some OOP.
